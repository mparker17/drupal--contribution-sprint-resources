To verify SHA256 sums
---------------------

1. In a terminal, run:

        $ cd $this_folder
        $ shasum -a256 -c virtualbox_5.2.26_SHA256SUMS

    ...if verification succeeded, it should print "OK" next to the file you plan to open.

Note that I didn't download _everything_ for this version of VirtualBox, so you'll get a handful of "FAILED open or read" errors... the important thing is that it say "OK" next to the file you plan to open.

If you see anything else next to the file you plan to open, then there was disc corruption, a network interruption during the download, or someone tampered with the file, and you should re-download everything (signature, sum, and file you intend to open) from https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html and re-run these steps, or ask for help.
