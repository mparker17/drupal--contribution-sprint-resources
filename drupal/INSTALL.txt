This folder contains clone(s) of Drupal core.

Choose the latest one from the date in the filename (dates are in ISO 8601 format, i.e.: yyyy-mm-dd), and extract it.

It will contain a full Git repository clone of Drupal core, with `composer install` already been run, so you should simply be able to point your development environment at the folder, and have everything work.

As the Drupal community says, "the Drop is always moving", so it will likely be a bit out-of-date, even if the date in the filename was yesterday or today. However, it should be close enough for you to test and/or write patches without issue.

The idea is that we don't want everyone in the sprint to bog down the internet by cloning Drupal and trying to run `composer install` all at once... that'll make the sprint slow and annoying for everyone. However, if you really really really need to have the latest code, run...

    $ git pull --rebase
    $ composer install

... but there's a good chance composer will try to download everything even if it hasn't changed to build it's local package cache... sorry.
