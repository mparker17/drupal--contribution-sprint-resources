Shortcuts
---------

I (mparker17) downloaded the script at https://get.docksal.io so instead of running...

    $ DOCKER_NATIVE=1 bash <(curl -fsSL https://get.docksal.io)
    # or
    $ bash <(curl -fsSL https://get.docksal.io)

... you can run...

    $ DOCKER_NATIVE=1 bash <(get-docksal.sh)
    # or
    $ bash <(get-docksal.sh)

... in this folder.

Alternately, you can rename the `docksal--fin.sh` in this folder to `fin`, make it run-able with `chmod u+x fin` and put it somewhere in your shell's PATH.
